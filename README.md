# Bouncing-Ball

## Description

This is a demo that uses various facets of a
JavaScript library to set bounds and change velocity and 
colors upon reaching these bounds.

## Installation

As long as the two files are in the same 
directory and the appropriate libraries are provided,
it should be plug and play.

## Usage

This project can be expanded upon with computer graphics and tinkering with the parameters.

## Support

Mozilla Developer Network JavaScript documentation

## Roadmap

Adding more bouncing balls and varying different
parameters to create an aesthetically pleasing rendering
