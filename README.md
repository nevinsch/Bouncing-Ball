JavaScript library to set bounds and change velocity and 
colors upon reaching these bounds.

Installation: As long as the two files are in the same 
directory, it should be plug and play.

Usage: can be expanded upon with computer graphics
Where to find out more: HTML5 Canvas and Mozilla Developer

parameters to create an aesthetically pleasing rendering
